#Treatment For Migraine

The data consist of headache logs kept by 133 patients in a treatment program in which bio-feedback was used to attempt to reduce migraine frequency and severity. Patients entered the program at different times over a period of about 3 years. Patients were encouraged to begin their logs four weeks before the onset of treatment and to continue for one month afterwards, but only 55 patients have data preceding the onset of treatment


Using above dataset built a datascience project using classification method to predict Best Cure Treatment for thr Migraine patient.

For the above Scenario we used CART Algorithm to Build the model to predict the Outcome of the Treatment.

Upon on applying CART we can able to seggrgate the patients data which are Cured by Migraine and their Undergone Treatment and Provided the same to the resercher so that effectiveness of the each tratment can be ananlysed for the better treatment in the feature.
